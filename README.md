Portfolio of my works from CSUSM
Assignments and project during my second year at CSUSM from my Intro to Software Engineering and Data Structures and Algorithms class
For my Intro to SE class we made teams of 3 and had to come up with a good enough project that would be challenging, yet achieveable in a semesters worth time.
Using the Agile, method my team and I, created a schedule, plan, and execution accordingly to create the app we desired which was a CSUSM app that was more centered around the students and their needs rather than the school.
That file is labeled "CSUSM App"
